            origami.h and origami.cpp have significant changes;
            the function readAnglesTrace() appears in several places


parachute"

            parachute.cpp has folding function calls and definitions.
            folding plans fogm* files in the directory -- found a good
            initialization using the folding method; need to find the

            the input files he used to work with the mrun script.

            pressure field looks very good, but could just be due to large
            animation frame interval -- check projection method in iFluid.
