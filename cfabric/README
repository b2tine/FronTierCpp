Example 1:

To run the in-swing file, use the following command.

    ./fabric_Fortn -d 2 -i in-swing -o out-swing

The output will be written to the directory ./out-swing.
Upon completion, a gif of the simulation will be created in ./out-swing/gd,
and can be viewed with the ImageMagick animate command

    i.e. animate intfc-gd.gif

All 2d input files generate this file; 3d input files do not.

Several vtk files will also be generated in the subdirectories of ./out-swing/vtk
To prepare these for postprocessing with Paraview or Visit, change the working
directory to ./out-swing/vtk and use the lsp2d command from FronTierCpp/bin (add to your PATH).
This will create a movie_index directory with data groups that can be loaded into
Paraview or Visit.


Example 2:

To run the in-drumC file, use the following command.

    ./fabric_Fortn -d 3 -i in-drumC -o out-drumC

The lsp3d command (also in FronTierCpp/bin) can be used in the ./out-drumC/vtk directory
to generate the movie_index.


Same procedure for examples 3 and 4 of report-III
