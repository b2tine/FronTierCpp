Input files for 2d and 3d examples are in input-2d and input-3d respectively.

Example 1:

To run the in-swing file, use the following command.

    ./fabric_Fortn -d 2 -i input-2d/in-swing -o out-swing

The output will be written to the directory ./out-swing.
Upon completion, a gif of the simulation will be created in ./out-swing/gd,
and can be viewed with the ImageMagick animate command

    i.e. animate intfc-gd.gif

All 2d input files generate this file; 3d input files do not.

Several vtk files will also be generated in the subdirectories of ./out-swing/vtk
To prepare these for postprocessing with Paraview or Visit, change the working
directory to ./out-swing/vtk and use the lsp2d command from FronTierCpp/bin (add to your PATH).
This will create a movie_index directory with data groups that can be loaded into
Paraview or Visit. This can also be done for 3d input files using the lsp3d command.
