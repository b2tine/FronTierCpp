To run examples, first copy input files from one of the input-*
directories into the current working directory.

    i.e.    cp input-2d/* .
    or      cp input-3d/* .

Then pass the desired casename to the script frun2d, or frun3d.
For example, to run with the input file "in-swing" from input-2d,

            ./frun2d swing 

and to run with the input file "in-drumC" from input-3d,

            ./frun3d drumC


the output will be written to directories in the current directory
with the casename prefixed by out, e.g "out-drumC-F", the suffix
indicates which script, frun* or crun*, was used.
